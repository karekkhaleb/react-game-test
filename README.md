###thank you for the test
my answer is an standard create react app form,
I have not run build because there are many features that I have not ye implemented


To run the app or play the game, you should have node and yarn or npm then:

1. extract the archive to your preferred location
2. run yarn install (even npm will do) to install the dependencies
3. run yarn start to start the development server
3.1 you may also run build it but I have not tried it so errors may arise!!

##Thanks
`so I really thank you for the test though I did not respect the deadline but
it was great doing it: I like it when you say "you must have fun doing it!!!"`
